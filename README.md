# hanabi
A personal project to create an online version of the board/card game Hanabi. 
Hanabi is a card game that is best described as multiplayer, blind, cooperative solitaire with fireworks.
I enjoyed playing this game with my friends and wanted to challenge myself to learn python and its various libraries.
This project is made using tkinter and sockets for communication.
Version 1 was an implimentation for one computer in the command line. Each players was shown sequentally.
Version 2 added multiplayer support and real time communication.
Version 3 changed to using a gui interface and buttons to play.
